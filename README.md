This is a basic Todo app that was a first project that utilized the React.js libary and utilized material.ui to make the application look more aesthetic. I utilized the useState hook and basic javascript ideas such as mapping throughout an array to perform the function of adding todos. I also utilized props to add css styling to my components.
